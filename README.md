A Multi-task Expressive Speech Synthesis Model.

"Prosody Modeling with Multi-Task Learning in Tacotron-based TTS",


 

## Audio samples

Examples of synthesized speech by "__Tacotron__" , "__PE-Tacotron__" and "__MTL-Tacotron__"system.

Speech samples are available at [speech samples page](https://ttslr.github.io/Tacotron-perceptual-loss/).


** **_Note: These samples are synthesized from Mel-spectrum by Griffin-Lim algorithm. We just need to pay attention to prosody because this work has no relation with sound quality basically._**
